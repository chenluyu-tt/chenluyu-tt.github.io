  <h1>Welcome to my page! Hello, Iâ€™m Brigitta</h1>
  <p>Iâ€™m a college student passionate about biomedical engineering, human-centered AI, and genomics.</p>

  <section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a first-year student at Bard College at Simonâ€™s Rock and a future biomedical engineer. Iâ€™m fascinated by human health, machine learning, and genetic technology â€” but what drives me is personal: my momâ€™s medical experience, veterans I grew up with, and my love for science as a tool for dignity and healing. Iâ€™ve co-authored an SCI paper, built AI health tools, and am currently preparing for BWSIâ€™s Medlytics program this summer.
